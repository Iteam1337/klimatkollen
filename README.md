## About

Free our climate data! Klimatkollen is an open source and citizen-driven climate data platform aimed at visualising local climate data. 

<b>The</b> problem: Most of Sweden’s 290 cities and municipalities are not slashing carbon emissions fast enough to be in line with the Paris Agreement. Furthermore, climate data that can help us is often locked behind paywalls or sits in complex government databases. If we can’t clearly see how much CO2 is being emitted, from which sources and how quickly we need to decarbonise – we can’t create a public opinion strong enough to change the course of our future. 

This needs to change.

That’s why we’re building a data-driven movement of climate-savvy developers to help us find and visualise climate data for the public. 

Please climb onboard to help us set our climate data free! #Klimatkollen /#FreeClimateData

## Get started

We use next.js and Typescript and it's pretty straightforward to get started. Just clone the repo and run:

    npm ci
    npm run dev

This opens up a webserver on http://localhost:3000. Just edit the code and see the live refresh.

## Contribute

The idea behind Klimatkollen is to give citizens access to the climate data we need to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement – and save our own future.
