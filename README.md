## About

A general perception is that Sweden is far ahead in climate change adaptation. When looking at the data, it turns out that not a single municipality is living up to the Paris Agreement. The information is not available to everyone. A map where you can see exactly how things stand has been put together with the data. Anyone can go in and see how their municipality is doing in terms of climate change. What has been built is just the beginning. It's all open source and we really encourage anyone involved in the climate issue to help build on this.

## Get started

We use next.js and Typescript and it's pretty straight forward to get started. Just clone the repo and run:

    npm ci
    npm run dev

This opens up a webserver on http://localhost:3000. Just edit the code and see the live refresh.

## Contribute
